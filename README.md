# New-web-agency-design-project-2
--I forgot to put the link in index file--After I watch how the instructor made this project, I'm still confused. But it's easier to try again. But I kinda understand why my 2 div aren't live next to each other in the same line even though I already give them inline value. I have to make them into smaller boxes by adjusting their width. **It look even worse than previous work on iphone and ipad.**
